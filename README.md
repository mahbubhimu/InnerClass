# Inner Class
When one Class is defined within another class then this is called Nested/ Inner Class.
Inner Class can access the Private Member of outer class but Outer class can not access/refer any member of Inner class.
We can not create Object of Inner Class outside the Outer Class.
The Scope/Lifetime of inner class is within the Outer Class.
